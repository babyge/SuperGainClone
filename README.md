# Stereo Super Gain Clone layout

This is a two-channel PCB layout for the LM3886-based Super Gain Clone by Bob Cordell.  It can be found in Chapter 27 in his book "Audio Amplifiers."

This project layout separates signal and power grounds as specified in the schematic.  It is intended to be a compact layout that will fit in a small amplifier case.  The two input ground should be joined where they enter the chassis, as they are not joined on the PCB except for hum breakers resistors.
